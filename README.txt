Portfolio placeholder images (REAL JPEGs)

These files are meant to replace the current placeholder files that may not render if they're SVG content saved as .jpg.

Copy into your repo root (overwriting existing files):

assets/img/portfolio/austin-sfr/hero.jpg
assets/img/portfolio/austin-sfr/gallery-01.jpg ... gallery-12.jpg
assets/img/portfolio/saraland-24/hero.jpg
assets/img/portfolio/saraland-24/gallery-01.jpg ... gallery-12.jpg
assets/img/portfolio/blyth-str/hero.jpg
assets/img/portfolio/blyth-str/gallery-01.jpg ... gallery-12.jpg

Then swap each file with your real photos later (keep filenames).
