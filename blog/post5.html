        <p class="article-lead">Short-term rental is not a strategy. It’s a revenue model—and like any revenue model, it has specific demand requirements, specific costs, and specific failure modes. The operators who’ve had the most trouble with STR portfolios in recent years weren’t operating bad properties. They were operating properties in markets where the STR revenue thesis didn’t hold up under actual conditions. The evaluation framework should start there, before the acquisition, not after.</p>

        <h2>Demand source is the first question, not the return projection</h2>
        <p>Before any discussion of ADR targets or occupancy projections, the question is: who is staying in this property, and why? STR demand is not uniform. It comes from distinct sources, each with different characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tourism and leisure travel:</strong> highly seasonal, concentrated around weekends and holidays, sensitive to economic conditions and flight routes. A property in a beach destination or mountain resort market rides this demand. A property in a mid-sized suburban market does not have this demand regardless of what you list it for on Airbnb.</li>
          <li><strong>Event-driven demand:</strong> concerts, sporting events, conferences, graduations. Strong in markets like Austin with a consistent event calendar. This demand is real and bookable but uneven—it creates peak weeks and quiet weeks with a wide ADR spread between them.</li>
          <li><strong>Business travel:</strong> predictable, weekday-heavy, less rate-sensitive than leisure. Most relevant in markets with corporate headquarters and active business districts. Less seasonal than tourism.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>MTR demand is different in kind:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Traveling healthcare workers:</strong> contract-to-contract, typically 8–13 week stays. Furnished Finder, agency-direct placements. Demand tied to proximity to hospital systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Corporate relocations and extended assignments:</strong> employees on temporary assignment who need furnished housing. Steadier than tourism, driven by employer presence in the market.</li>
          <li><strong>Insurance-funded stays:</strong> homeowners displaced by fire, flood, or renovation. Less predictable in timing but high-quality tenants with reliable payment (insurance carrier is paying).</li>
          <li><strong>Graduate students and academic relocations:</strong> university towns see consistent MTR demand from incoming faculty, researchers, and students who need furnished housing for a semester or two.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you can’t specifically identify the demand source for your target market and property type before you buy, you don’t have an STR or MTR thesis. You have an assumption.</p>

        <h2>What STR actually costs to operate</h2>
        <p>STR pro formas typically show gross revenue with a vacancy percentage. They rarely show the full cost structure, which is why STR deals that look attractive at the underwriting stage often disappoint at the operating stage. The real cost items:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> $100–175 per turn in most markets, sometimes more in larger properties. A 2/2 doing 12 bookings per month is spending $1,200–2,100/month on cleaning alone before accounting for supplies.</li>
          <li><strong>Consumables and amenities:</strong> coffee, toiletries, paper goods, kitchen basics. Budget $40–70/month ongoing, more for properties targeting premium positioning.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform fees:</strong> Airbnb’s host fee is typically 3% of the booking subtotal. The guest service fee (10–14.2%) affects your pricing relative to comparable options and can limit how high you can price before losing bookings.</li>
          <li><strong>Furniture and linens:</strong> initial outfitting for a 2/2 runs $8,000–15,000 depending on quality level. Replacement cycles are 3–5 years, not 10. Budget a furniture reserve.</li>
          <li><strong>Property management if not self-managing:</strong> STR management typically costs 20–30% of gross revenue, reflecting the operational intensity versus 8–10% for long-term rentals.</li>
          <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> STR owners typically pay all utilities. A long-term rental tenant pays their own electricity; your Airbnb guests do not. In a Texas summer, that’s a material expense line.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Net margins on STR are usually 55–70% of gross revenue after all operating expenses, before debt service. Underwriting to 80% is optimistic; underwriting to 90% is not realistic in any market with full cost accounting.</p>

        <h2>Regulatory risk is not a footnote</h2>
        <p>Every major STR market in the country has dealt with some form of regulation in the last five years. Austin requires a short-term rental license and limits the number of licenses per owner depending on property type and owner-occupancy status. Other markets—Portland, Palm Springs, New York City—have moved significantly further, effectively banning non-owner-occupied STR in residential zones.</p>
        <p>The risk isn’t that regulation is inevitable everywhere. It’s that the regulatory path is determined by local politics and neighborhood pressure, which are genuinely hard to predict four or five years out. A STR property in a residential neighborhood depends on an entitlement that can be revoked or restricted without the owner having meaningful recourse.</p>
        <p>The work here is reading the actual municipal code, not summarizing what Airbnb’s help center says about it. Know the permit requirements, the density caps, the owner-occupancy rules, and the political trajectory of the local council. If you can’t do that analysis for a specific property, that’s information—the regulatory picture isn’t clear enough to underwrite with confidence.</p>

        <h2>The mid-term rental as a base case</h2>
        <p>In many markets and property types, mid-term rental produces net revenue competitive with STR once you normalize for operating costs and vacancy. A 2/2 furnished at $2,200/month on a 90-day MTR lease, fully occupied for the year, produces $26,400 gross. An STR at $150 ADR with 70% occupancy produces $38,325 gross—but after cleaning, supplies, platform fees, utilities, and management, the net is closer to $25,000–27,000. The gap is smaller than it looks on the headline numbers, and MTR comes with lower operational complexity and zero regulatory exposure in most jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>MTR also benefits from diversified booking channels: Furnished Finder, corporate housing networks, direct hospital system relationships, and word of mouth from previous tenants. Platform dependency is lower than STR, where a single Airbnb policy change or review issue can affect your listing visibility materially.</p>

        <h2>The fallback framework every deal needs</h2>
        <p>Any property we consider for STR or MTR is underwritten through a three-scenario waterfall:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>STR:</strong> what does cash flow look like at realistic occupancy (70–75%, not 85%) with full operating cost accounting?</li>
          <li><strong>MTR:</strong> what does cash flow look like at furnished monthly rates with 2–4 weeks annual vacancy between tenants?</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term rental:</strong> what does cash flow look like at market-rate unfurnished long-term rent, with vacancy at 8–10%?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the LTR scenario doesn’t cover debt service plus basic operating expenses, the deal is only working in the best-case scenario. That’s not a deal—it’s a bet on conditions that may not persist. The STR upside is real and worth pursuing if you can manage the operations, but it should never be the reason the deal pencils. Deals that require STR revenue to work become problems when occupancy is 50% or the regulatory environment shifts.</p>
        <p>Strategy optionality only has value when all the strategies are viable. Otherwise you don’t have optionality—you have a dependency on conditions you can’t control.</p>
