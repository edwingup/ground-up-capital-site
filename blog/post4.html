        <h1>Why SFR and small multifamily still work in today’s market</h1>
        <p class="muted">By <strong>Edwin Sequeira</strong> • Feb 2026 • 13 min read</p>

    <article class="article">
      <div class="container article-inner">
        <p class=”article-lead”>The market narrative in 2025 and into 2026 is complicated: elevated rates, softening in certain multifamily segments, and a lot of uncertainty about where rents go from here. None of that changes the underlying case for SFR and small multifamily when you underwrite correctly. The question was never “is real estate going up?” It was always “does this specific asset, in this specific market, produce durable cash flow at a price that makes sense today?”</p>

        <h2>Why Austin and the Sunbelt remain the right focus</h2>
        <p>Market selection is the most consequential underwriting decision you make—more consequential than the rent growth assumption or the exit cap. A mediocre operator in a strong market will outperform an excellent operator in the wrong one.</p>
        <p>The Austin and Sunbelt thesis is not about appreciation speculation. It's about demand durability. Austin's employment base has diversified meaningfully beyond the tech sector over the last five years—healthcare systems, defense contractors, logistics, and manufacturing have all added headcount. The metro's population growth has slowed from its 2021–2022 pace but remains positive, and household formation has not kept pace with earlier projections, leaving genuine undersupply in workforce housing.</p>
        <p>The broader Sunbelt story is similar: landlord-friendly regulatory environments, relatively lower property taxes than coastal markets, and migration patterns that continue to favor growth metros in Texas, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Georgia. These aren't permanent tailwinds—markets shift—but they represent a more durable demand foundation than markets dependent on a single industry or experiencing net population outflows.</p>

        <h2>The case for SFR specifically</h2>
        <p>Single-family rentals occupy an unusual position in the housing market. The tenant profile skews toward families and individuals who want the experience of a single-family home but aren't buying—whether because of affordability constraints, life circumstances, or preference. This profile tends to produce longer tenancies than apartment rentals. Average lease lengths in SFR markets run 24–36 months against 12–18 months for comparable apartments. Longer tenancies mean lower turnover cost, lower vacancy, and more predictable cash flow.</p>
        <p>The financing picture also differs from institutional multifamily. SFR (and 1–4 unit properties generally) qualifies for residential loan products: conventional 30-year fixed-rate debt, FHA financing in some cases, and a variety of investor loan programs that don't depend on commercial market conditions. This gives SFR investors more financing options and more predictable debt costs than operators in the commercial multifamily space.</p>
        <p>Exit flexibility is another advantage that's easy to undervalue in a hold-and-operate underwrite. A well-located SFR can be sold to a retail buyer—a family who wants to own the home—not just to another investor. In a market where investor demand softens (as it did in 2022–2023), the retail buyer universe remains large. That optionality has real value.</p>

        <h2>Small multifamily (2–20 units): the institutional blind spot</h2>
        <p>Small multifamily sits below the radar of most institutional capital for a structural reason: deal size. Funds with hundreds of millions in AUM can't deploy efficiently into 8-unit buildings. That creates a consistent opportunity for smaller operators—less competition, more motivated sellers, and pricing that reflects the seller's circumstances rather than a fully competitive auction process.</p>
        <p>On the financing side, 1–4 unit small multifamily qualifies for residential debt (with the same advantages described above). Five-plus units moves into commercial financing territory, but the DSCR-based loan products available to operators in this space are reasonably priced and flexible compared to larger commercial deals. Rates are higher than they were in 2020–2021, but they're underwriteable if you're buying at a price that supports today's debt costs rather than projecting yourself into positive leverage that doesn't exist yet.</p>
        <p>Operations at the small multifamily level are also more controllable than large apartment complexes. You're working with a single property, a single maintenance vendor relationship, and a small tenant base where individual attention to occupancy and renewals is possible. A 10% vacancy on an 8-unit building is one empty unit. The response is targeted, not systemic.</p>

        <h2>What the underwriting discipline actually requires</h2>
        <p>Every deal we evaluate gets stress-tested against a set of conservative base assumptions before we look at the upside case:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vacancy:</strong> minimum 8–10%, regardless of current market conditions or what the T12 shows. Markets soften. Tenant circumstances change. A deal that only works at 3% vacancy is not underwritten.</li>
          <li><strong>Rents:</strong> in-place T12 actuals, not projected market rents. If there's an in-place-to-market spread, we model the achievable portion conservatively and stress-test the timeline.</li>
          <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> management fee at full market rate (8–10% of EGI), not at what the current owner pays themselves. Capex reserves at $150–$250/door/year minimum, more for older stock with deferred maintenance.</li>
          <li><strong>Debt coverage:</strong> 1.20x or better at current rates in year one. If the deal only pencils at 1.05x coverage hoping that rates drop, it's not a deal yet.</li>
          <li><strong>Downside case:</strong> 10–15% income reduction from base. If that scenario produces negative cash flow, we understand the timeline and magnitude before we proceed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The deals that don't survive these screens aren't bad assets—they're often fine assets at the wrong price. In a market where sellers still have 2020–2021 price anchors, that gap between acceptable price and asked price is common. Discipline means walking away from those deals, not adjusting the vacancy assumption to make the model work.</p>

        <h2>Optionality is a feature, not a fallback</h2>
        <p>One structural advantage of SFR and small multifamily in the right locations is genuine strategy flexibility. An asset that sits in a market with both long-term rental demand and legitimate STR or mid-term rental demand isn't just an asset with a fallback—it's an asset you can optimize based on conditions. Regulatory environment changes, demand shifts seasonally, a medical center opens nearby that creates mid-term rental demand. The ability to respond operationally to those changes without selling or refinancing is worth something in the underwrite.</p>
        <p>We model every asset through at least two scenarios: the primary operating strategy and the conservative fallback. If the fallback doesn't produce acceptable cash flow, the primary strategy's upside doesn't save the deal. The flexibility only has value if both paths are viable.</p>
